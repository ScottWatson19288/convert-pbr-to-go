My attempt to convert physically based rendering https://pbrt.org/ which is in c/c++. the code I am working off is v3

I am trying to convert it over to golang and learn all of it as I go

My plan is to add TODO files for each section as needed because I am sure there is a lot of things that at first I wont be able to convert over.
Also I will be trying to build out the tests first and then the code and after that the benchmarks as needed.
